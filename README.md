# Simple UCAS

simple-ucas is a very simple frontend React application designed to make filling out invoices and taking minutes of a meeting easier. The client (my mum) helps French students get into English universities. Generating the text for her invoices is time-consuming, although the content is often very similar. This application fills in spaces with inputs, and adapts the French grammar according to who is the subject of the invoice (whether the student's name starts with a vowel, whether they use masculine or feminine pronouns).
